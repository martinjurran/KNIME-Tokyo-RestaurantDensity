## Introduction
Voronoi diagrams are powerful tools in data analysis, offering insights into spatial relationships and distributions. This repository includes a KNIME workflow for calculating service areas of train stations in Tokyo and analyzing restaurant density. By leveraging Voronoi diagrams, we can identify key insights, such as Ueno-okachimachi station having the highest restaurant density in Tokyo Prefecture.
